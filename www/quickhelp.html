<h4>General</h4>
<p>There are four main sections to moOde: Playback, Library, CoverView and Configuration.</p>
<p>Switching between Playback and the Library is accomplished by tapping on the cover art in Playback or on any open area of the Playbar in the Library.</p>

<h4>Playback</h4>
<p>The Playback screen includes the play queue (Queue), volume and time knobs, playback controls, cover art and metadata.

<h4>Library</h4>
<p>The library provides Radio, Folder, Tag and Album views for browsing and selecting content and a Playbar for displaying song information and controlling playback. Options for configuring various aspects of the Library including sort order, recently added and more are located in the Library section of the Preferences dialog.</p>
<h4>Searching the Library</h4>
<p>Powerful search features are available in Tag and Album view that allow the Library to be filtered based on entered text, tag value pairs or special, predefined filters. These are entered in the search field on the Library menu. There is also an Advanced search dialog that enables multiple tag value pairs to be submitted.</p>
<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> General</span>
			<p>Searches are not case sensitive and partial matches are considered valid.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Tag value pairs</span>
			<p>The following tags are supported: Any, Genre, Artist, Album, Title, Album Artist, Date, Composer, Conductor, Performer, Work, Comment and File.</p>
			<p>Examples: genre rock | artist frank sinatra | artist mccartney | any zeppelin</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> The Any tag</span>
			<p>The Any tag performs a search of all tags using an OR relationship. An Any search is automatically invoked when the first word of text entered in the search field does not match any of the tag or predefined filter names.</p>
			<p>Examples: yellow submarine | all that you can't leave behind | frank sinatra | 1962</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Predefined filters</span>
			<p>The following predefined filters are available: Encoded [bits/rate], Format [.ext], Folder [path], Hdonly, Lossless, Lossy and Year [yyyy] or [yyyy-yyyy].</p>
			<p>Examples: encoded 24/96 | encoded 192 | hdonly | format .dsf | folder u2/achtung baby | lossy | year 1962 | year 1994-1998</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

<h4>CoverView</h4>
<p>The CoverView screen saver provides a large sized cover art image, a Playbar for controlling playback and several backdrop Options that can be selected in the CoverView section of the Preferences dialog.</p>

<h4>Configuration</h4>
<p>The Configuration screens are accessed via the Main Menu and provide settings for the Library, Audio, Network and System.</p>

<h4>Queue</h4>
<p>The Queue is displayed in Playback and CoverView and contains all items to be played. It's populated primarily by selecting an item from the Library and then tapping one of the Queue commands listed on a context menu. It can also be populated automatically by Auto-shuffle. The Queue commands are listed below.</p>
<div id="quickhelp-bullet-list">
	<ul>
		<li><span> Add | Play</span>
			<p>The Add command adds the item to the end of the Queue. The Play command first checks to see if the item is already in the Queue and then plays the existing item otherwise it does the same as Add and then begins play.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Add next | Play next</span>
			<p>The "Add next" command adds the item immediately after the currently playing or last played item. The "Play next" command first checks to see if the item is already in the Queue and then plays the existing item otherwise it does the same as "Add next" then begins play.</p>
		</li>
		<li><span> Clear/Add | Clear/Play</span>
			<p>The Clear/Add command first clears the Queue then adds the item. The Clear/Play command does the same and then begins play.</p>
